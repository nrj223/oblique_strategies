            <h1>DUOMO</h1>
            <img src="img/duomo.jpg" height=auto width=400vw justify-content=center>
            <p> The Duomo Cathedral of Florence is basically a church. A duomo is an Italian word for a cathedral, or a Catholic church where the bishop is located. All cathedrals are designed with four perpendicular arms so that the entire building has the shape of a cross, symbolizing the crucifixion of Christ. </p>
                <p> It started construction in 1296 in the Gothic style to a design of Arnolfo di Cambio and was structurally completed by 1436, with the dome engineered by Filippo Brunelleschi. </p>
                    <p>  After lots of mathematical calculations, Brunelleschi decided to build a dome with a slight point, rather than a smooth, round top. This style, called ogival, helped reduce the pressure of the structure and made the base of the dome responsible for supporting its weight, which made it stronger.</p>
                        <p> The exterior of the basilica is faced with polychrome marble panels in various shades of green and pink, bordered by white. In typical Tuscan style, the church’s outside is covered in geometric patterns of marble blocks. </p>

            <img src = "img/PONTEVECCHIO.jpg" height = auto width = 450vw>
            <p>Ponte Vecchio, which in Italian means “old bridge”, was the first segmental arch bridge built in the West, which crosses over the Arno River at Florence. It is an outstanding engineering achievement of Europe’s Middle Ages. </p>
                <p>  Its builder, Taddeo Gaddi, completed the bridge in 1345. Requiring fewer piers in the stream than the Roman semicircular-arch design, the segmental arch offered less obstruction to navigation and freer passage to floodwaters. </p>
                    <p> During World War II, it was the only bridge across the Arno that the fleeing Germans did not destroy.  </p>
